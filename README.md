# Features

### Items

**All** items in the game are randomized, including normal items like item boxes and chuckle beans, hidden item boxes, key items, hammers and hand abilites, shop items, and more!

Any item option that is **Unchecked** will be put in the same location it can be found in vanilla MLSS

Areas will be **locked** until you get the required item that would normally open up the related area. 
i.e. Peasleys rose will let you into the castle, Beanbean brooch will let you into the chateau area.

The items locking the end of **Jokes End** are the Extra Dress and the Fake Beanstar.
If you have the Beanstar pieces option enabled, then the Completed Beanstar is also required to beat Jokes End.
Not having these items will stop you from progressing past Jojora and Chucklissa. (You can still fight them)

### Enemies

Bosses and enemies can be randomized. There are settings available to customize whether the enemy stats get scaled to the area, as well as if you want bosses to stay as a boss only, or for bosses to show up as normal encounters as well.

### Colors

Both the Hat and Pants colors can be changed resulting in a lot of fun color palettes for you to mix and match with. There are set colors that have been hand-crafted to make every color relating to the bros to whatever you choose. There are also a few fun and interesting color options for those daring. You can also make the bros any color you want if you have an RGB hex color.

### Misc. Features

**Skip intro:** Enabling this will put you right after the border Jump Minigame, skipping the intro sequence.

**Castle Start:** Enabling this will have you start in Beanbean Castle Town rather than stardust fields.

**Skip Bowsers Castle:** Enabling this will let you skip all of bowsers castle and go straight to Bowletta once you go through the first door.

**Skip Minecart minigame:** Enabling this will allow you to get to and from beanbean outskirts without needing to ride the minecarts every time.

**Disable Surf Minigame:** Enabling this will make the item in the surf minigame in Oho Ocean its vanilla item.

**Disable Mush Badge:** Enabling this will remove all versions of the mush badge from the game if you think they are too strong.

**Seed Type:** Setting this to 100% will make sure every key item in the game is accessible. With Any%, some items might be impossible to get even though you can still beat the game.

**Minigame Spoilers:** Enabling this will tell you what item a minigame will give you before you complete it, so you will know if you can skip it or not.

**Random Music and sounds:** Enabling these settings will randomize all music and sounds in the game respectively. Random sounds can be very chaotic, but it is a very funny feature if you like chaos! Unused and beta music is unearthed with the music randomization for you to enjoy.

**Disable Music:** Enabling this will disable all music. Enable this if you like to listen to your own music, or just want to hear the sounds of mario jumping nice and clearly :)

**Randomize Battle Backgrounds:** Enabling this will randomize the background of any enemy you fight including bosses, including some unused backgrounds.

**Randomize Mario/Luigi:** Enabling this will turn Luigi or Mario into an item! Until you find them, you can play the game as a solo brother and adventure with a new twist!

**Text Turbo:** At any point in the game, you can hold L/R + A to turbo through text. Note that this only works for text and nothing else.

**Teleport Anywhere Anytime:** At any point in the game, you can hold L + R and press SELECT to open up the Pipe Menu to teleport to any pipe you've accessed before.
(Note that when you press this button combination you must pick a pipe, you cannot go back to the room you were just in.)
